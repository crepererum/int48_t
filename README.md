# `int48_t`

This header-only library provides a very simple implementation of a 48bit signed integer (aka `int48_t`). It is
written using the C++11 standard and should basically be runnable by every semi-great compiler out there. The class
is designed to behave like a normal integer type, so most conversions will be implicit. There are no external
dependencies, apart from the C++ standard library.
